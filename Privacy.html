            COPPA requires that we receive verifiable parental consent from the child's parent or legal guardian before the collection, use, or disclosure of the child's Personal Data.

            Parents can always refuse to permit us to collect further Personal Data, request to review their child's Personal Data, or request that we delete from our records the personal data collected from or about their child. Please keep in mind that a request to delete records may lead to a termination of an account, membership, or other service, as the nature of our services requires collection of Personal Data. To exercise any of these options, please contact us at privacy@whitehatjr.com. Please be aware that to protect children’s privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify a parent or legal guardian’s identity before granting access to any personal data.</p>
